File handling in Python is a powerful and versatile tool that can be used to perform a wide range of operations. 
However, it is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of file handling when writing Python programs, to ensure that the code is secure, reliable, and performs well.
Before performing any operation on the file like reading or writing, first, we have to open that file. 
For this, we should use Python’s inbuilt function open() but at the time of opening, we have to specify the mode, which represents the purpose of the opening file.
Where the following mode is supported:
r: open an existing file for a read operation.
w: open an existing file for a write operation. If the file already contains some data, then it will be overridden but if the file is not present then it creates the file as well.
a: open an existing file for append operation. It won’t override existing data.
w+: To write and read data. It overwrites the previous file if one exists, it will truncate the file to zero length or create a file if it does not exist.
a+: To append and read data from the file. It won’t override existing data.
